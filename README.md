# Python Intro Homework Exercises

This repository contains my first Python homework assignments and coding experiments.  
Each script demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including printing, arithmetic operators, strings vs. integers, error handling, and working with dates and locations.

## Contents
- Printing names with quotations and parentheses
- Using multiplication (*) and power (**) operators
- Avoiding common syntax errors (quotes, leading zeros)
- Difference between numbers and strings
- Location and date print examples
- Simple math operations

 *Full source code: [assignment1.py](assignment1.py)*

All code is written and tested by myself as part of my learning journey.  
Feel free to review, ask questions, or provide feedback!

### Part A — Errors in Python IDLE
![Errors Screenshot](screenshots/PartA—ErrorsinPythonIDLE.png)
Part A — Demonstrating common Python errors using print statements in IDLE. Shows SyntaxError for missing quotes, missing parentheses, and using names without quotes. These errors help new learners understand how to debug code.

### Part B — Arithmetic Operations

Part B — Python arithmetic operations. Shows correct outputs for multiplication (*) and power (**) operators in Python.

### Part C — Leading Zero Error
![Leading Zero Error](screenshots/partc_leading_zero.png)  
Part C — Leading zero error in Python. Shows SyntaxError for using leading zeros in integer literals, helping to understand numeric syntax rules.

### Part D — Integer and String Type
![Integer vs String](screenshots/partd_type.png)  
Part D — Demonstrating the difference between integer and string in Python using the type() function in Command Line. Shows how Python distinguishes between int and str data types.

### Part 2 — Printing Location, Date, Temperature
![Location, Date, Temperature](screenshots/part-2.png)  
Part 2 — Printing location, date range, and temperature in Python IDLE. Shows correct use of the print() function for displaying text information such as city, country, start/end dates, and temperature values.

## Assignment 2 — Circle Circumference & Discount Calculator

This assignment demonstrates:
- Calculating the circumference of a circle from user input using the formula \(C = 2\pi r\).
- Calculating sale prices and discounts for individual items, combo packs (two items, 10% off each) and gift packs (three items, 25% off each).

### Circle Calculation

- Input: 5 → Output: circumference is 31.4159
- Input: 15 → Output: circumference is 94.2478
- Input: 100 → Output: circumference is 628.3185

### Discount Calculator

- **Single item:** cost=200, discount=0% → Sale price: 200.0
- **Combo pack:** items=200 & 400, discounts=10% each → Sale price: 540.0
- **Gift pack:** items=200, 400, 600, discounts=25% each → Sale price: 900.0
