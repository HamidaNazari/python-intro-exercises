# Python Intro Homework Exercises

This repository contains my first Python homework assignments and coding experiments.
Each script demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including printing, arithmetic operators, strings vs. integers, error handling, and working with dates and locations.

## Contents
- Printing names with quotations and parentheses
- Using multiplication (*) and power (**) operators
- Avoiding common syntax errors (quotes, leading zeros)
- Difference between numbers and strings
- Location and date print examples
- Simple math operations

All code is written and tested by myself as part of my learning journey.
Feel free to review, ask questions, or provide feedback!
