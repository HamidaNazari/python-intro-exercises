# A. Printing name with parentheses and quotation marks
# If one or both quotes are missing, Python returns a syntax error.
# >>> print("Hamia Nazari)      # SyntaxError: incomplete input
# >>> print(Hamida Nazari)      # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
print("Hamida Nazari")            # Correct usage

# B. The difference between * (multiplication) and ** (power) operators
print(8 * 2)   # Output: 16 (multiplication)
print(8 ** 2)  # Output: 64 (power)

# C. Integers with leading zeros cause syntax errors
# >>> 09             # SyntaxError in Python
# >>> print(0o1)     # Output: 1 (octal format)

# D. Difference between a number and string in Python
print(67)      # Output: 67 (integer)
print('67')    # Output: '67' (string)

# E. Age multiplication
age = 26
print(age * 2)  # Output: 52

# F. Printing location (city and country)
print("Nawan shehr, Abbotabd, Pakistan")

# G. Printing term dates
print("Started on 16 November 2023- Ends on 10 January 2023")

# H. Printing temperature
print("Thursday 19c-8c")
