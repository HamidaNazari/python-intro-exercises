## Overview

This project demonstrates **recursion** using two simple Python functions:

1. **Countup**  
   - Recursively counts up from a negative number to 0.  
   - Prints each number along the way.  
   - Displays `"Blastoff!"` when zero is reached.

2. **Countdown**  
   - Recursively counts down from a positive number to 0.  
   - Prints each number along the way.  
   - Displays `"Blastoff!"` when zero is reached.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the code.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `countup_countdown.py`.  
3. Run the script:

```bash
python countup_countdown.py
Enter the starting numbers as prompted:

A negative number for countup.

A positive number for countdown.
